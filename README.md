# DhallJ

This project is a set of libraries and tools for working with the [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/)
configuration language on the JVM.

It's currently a work in progress.

## Mostly done

* Alpha normalization
* Encoding to CBOR

## Mostly done but less so

* Parsing (currently missing imports and text interpolation)
* Error messages (currently okay but not great)
* Beta normalization (passing all but 10 of the 200-ish normalization tests)

## Barely started

* Scala interop
* JSON export
* etc.
